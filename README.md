A brief Data Analysis of Used cars 2019 Dataset for the predilection of automotives selling pattern
First Data Analysis shot, apologies for not being perfect.
I have also attached a IEEE data analysis report.
The link of dataset is in the report due to size issue.
One can drop unneccessary columns by runnig :- cars.drop(columns=['nrOfPictures','seller','offerType'], inplace=True) 
in jupyter notebook or any ide you're using. However, if your prediction requires any of these columns then please do not perform this.
